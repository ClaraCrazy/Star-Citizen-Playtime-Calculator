Star Citizen is sadly missing the option to view your playtime. So, I wrote my own script to do just that. 

<br>
It works fairly simple:

- Upon starting the script, it will ask you to select your games install folder (RSI/StarCitizen/Live)
- After selecting that, the script will calculate the playtime based on the logfiles

----

Sadly, the script will not work properly if you deleted said folder in the past. I recommend just deleting the contents of that folder, but keeping the directory "logbackup" intact.
